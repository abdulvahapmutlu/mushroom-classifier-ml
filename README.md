# mushroom-classifier-ml
This  is an end-to-end machine learning pipeline for identifying whether a mushroom is **edible** or **poisonous** based on its physical characteristics. Using a diverse dataset and state-of-the-art machine learning techniques, this project demonstrates best practices in preprocessing, training, evaluation, and model explainability.
